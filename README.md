# Note-Pad-App-for-Business-Owners

https://note-express12.herokuapp.com/

## Description 

For this application, I have deployed this onto Heroku which the application is a Note-Pad Application for users to create Notes and save them for future reference. The routes to all pages are done using Express to get to each page and each js, css or html file.

## Technologies Used

For this application, I had used a few JS Dependecies to create this application. One big one I had used for Express.js which created the routes to access each page by creating get and post requests and putting it through to the localhost port/heroku deployment url. I also used Fs module to create the notes for the user to write in and for them to save it on the side of the page.

## Challenges Faces

One of the biggest challenges of this application was deploying to Heroku. The main reason for this was because a lot of the dependencies used in this appilcation were either not installed or not defined properly which caused Heroku to crash and not able to deploy the application. After I had resolved this matter, everything had been deployed. Another challenge I had faced was my CSS file not working on the notes.html page and this was because of the connection between the css, js and html pages. The routes to get to each page were not correctly done and some of the files would not exist. After I readjusted this, the css file could run on the pages.
