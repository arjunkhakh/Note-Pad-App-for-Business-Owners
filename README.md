## Heroku Link

https://note-express12.herokuapp.com/

## Description 

For this application, I have deployed this onto Heroku which the application is a Note-Pad Application for users to create Notes and save them for future reference. The routes to all pages are done using Express to get to each page and each js, css or html file.

## Technologies Used

For this application, I had used a few JS Dependecies to create this application. One big one I had used for Express.js which created the routes to access each page by creating get and post requests and putting it through to the localhost port/heroku deployment url. I also used Fs module to create the notes for the user to write in and for them to save it on the side of the page.
